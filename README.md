## OCaml Programming Repository
Welcome to the OCaml Programming Concepts repository! This repository is dedicated to covering key topics related to OCaml programming. As of creating this repository, I am enrolled in CMSC330: Organization of Programming Languages, in which OCaml is being covered. The main reason for creating this repository is to solidify my understanding of topics before our first exam.

#### Overview
1. Programming Language Concepts
2. OCaml Introduction
3. OCaml Typing/Pattern Matching
4. Imperative OCaml
5. Regular Expressions
6. Finite State Machines
NFAs/DFAs: Understand Non-deterministic Finite Automata (NFAs) and Deterministic Finite Automata (DFAs) concepts using OCaml.

Thanks for checking this repository out!
